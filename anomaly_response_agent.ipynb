    "This notebook has demonstrated a simplified but powerful concept in AIOps: an autonomous agent for incident response. By following the **Observe-Orient-Decide-Act** loop, the agent was able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Observe:** Detect a CPU spike.\n",
    "2.  **Orient:** Correlate the spike with high CPU usage from a specific process and a critical memory error in the logs.\n",
    "3.  **Decide:** Conclude that the application's memory leak was the root cause.\n",
    "4.  **Act:** Recommend a specific, actionable remediation step (restarting the process).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing such agents can dramatically reduce the Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for common incidents, freeing up human engineers to focus on more complex problems."
